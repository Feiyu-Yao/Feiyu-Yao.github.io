<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a research assistant at Westlake University, working on Visual Language Navigation and applying sensors to capture motion.  My research interest includes multimodal tasks, sensor tasks, embodied AI and domain generalization. 
I graduated from Columbia University with a master of science degree. My major is Mechanical Engineering and my concentration is robotics and control. I received a B.E degree at Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

[Few-shot Domain Adaptation for IMU Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01537)

**Feiyu Yao**, Zongkai Wu, Zhenyu Wei, Donglin Wang

‚Ä¢ We are the first to take notice of the low-cost IMU denoising generalization problem brought by different IMUs in different application scenarios and locate the problem to the Embedding module.
  
‚Ä¢ We propose an IMU denoising method composed by a domain adaptation framework and a corresponding few-shot learning strategy for domain generalization.
  
‚Ä¢ We implement our proposed IMU denoising method both on open dataset (EuRoC and TUM-VI) and two real robot (car and quadruped robots) with multiple IMUs. The performance verifies the effectiveness of our method.

[Model reference adaptive tracking control for hydraulic servo systems with nonlinear neural-networks]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01537](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001905781930521X))

Zhikai Yao, Jianyong Yao, **Feiyu Yao**, Qiang Xu, Minrui Xu, Wenxiang Deng
  

‚Ä¢ This paper proposes a composite design of nonlinear neural-networks (NN) and continuous robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback controller. 
  
‚Ä¢ To achieve asymptotic stability, a novel RISE term with NN-based feedforward component is developed for the first time to enable the incorporation of model reference adaptive control structure where acceleration signal is not employed. 

‚Ä¢ The proposed controller guarantees controlled hydraulic system a semi-global asymptotic stability.
